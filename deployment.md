## Deployment Instructions

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables should be configured in your deployment environment:

```bash
# Required for production
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret-key-here

# Optional - OpenWeather API for real weather data
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your-openweather-api-key

# Database configuration (when migrating from in-memory to PostgreSQL)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database_name
PGHOST=your-db-host
PGPORT=5432
PGUSER=your-db-username
PGPASSWORD=your-db-password
PGDATABASE=your-db-name
```

### Replit Deployment

1. **Automatic Deployment**: The application is configured to work seamlessly with Replit's deployment system
2. **Port Configuration**: The app automatically binds to `0.0.0.0:5000` for proper external access
3. **Build Process**: Vite handles the frontend build automatically
4. **Static File Serving**: Express serves both API and frontend assets

### External Deployment Options

#### Render.com Deployment

1. **Connect Repository**: Link your Git repository to Render
2. **Service Configuration**:
   - Build Command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Start Command: `npm start`
   - Environment: Node.js
   - Plan: Choose based on expected traffic

3. **Environment Variables**: Configure all required environment variables in Render dashboard

#### Heroku Deployment

1. **Prepare for Heroku**:
   ```bash
   # Create Procfile
   echo "web: npm start" > Procfile
   ```

2. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   heroku create agroconnect-ghana
   heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production
   heroku config:set JWT_SECRET=your-secure-secret
   git push heroku main
   ```

#### Railway Deployment

1. **Connect Repository**: Import project from GitHub to Railway
2. **Environment Variables**: Configure in Railway dashboard
3. **Automatic Deployment**: Railway will detect Node.js and deploy automatically

### Database Migration (Production Ready)

To migrate from in-memory storage to PostgreSQL for production:

1. **Install Database Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install @neondatabase/serverless drizzle-orm drizzle-kit
   ```

2. **Update Storage Implementation**:
   - Replace `MemStorage` with `DrizzleStorage` in `server/storage.ts`
   - Use the existing database schema from `shared/schema.ts`

3. **Run Migrations**:
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```
